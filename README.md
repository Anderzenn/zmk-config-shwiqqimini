# WIP

Shwiqqi Mini is at it's core a TKL but with some of the keys moved to the left side, dedicated media keys and a rotary knob.
In it's current version it is made using a knock-off Nice Nano V2 soldering directly to the PCB - The board also don't have any LEDs at the moment. This is due to a lack of available pins with a pre-made controller, even with the pcb using a duplex matrix to reduce the amount of pins being used.

This is just a hobby project that I decided to make for fun, to improve and work on my skills with pcb design.
